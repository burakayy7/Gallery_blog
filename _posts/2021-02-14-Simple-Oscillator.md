For almost the past 2 years, I have been trying to make a simple oscillator circuit without using a 555 Timer. I have tried various ideas with capacitors and transistor but I was never able to figure out how to make them oscillate. Then one day I stumbled upon and idea I found on the internet and that led me to this circuit:

It might look complicated, but it actually isn't. This type of oscillator is called a CC Relaxation Circuit. It consists of 2 transistors that are paired with 2 capacitors and 2 resistors (there are actually 2 more resistors, but those are for the LEDs).
